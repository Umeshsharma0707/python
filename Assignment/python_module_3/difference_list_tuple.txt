que : What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

-> tuple is a datatype in python,which is similar to a list
because it is also an ordered collection datatype.
which is used to store multiple items of different datatypes.

Difference:
List :
-> list is mutable means you can modify changes in list 
after creating.
you can add,remove or change elements in list 
-> due to its mutable behaviour,list may require more 
memory and have slower performance than tuple.

Tuple :
-> tuple is immutable means you cannot modify changes in tuple.
-> you cannot add or remove elements after creating a tuple.
-> tuples have faster performance than lists.

lists are  defined by using : square brackets []
tuples are defined by using : parenthesis ()
